git clone is the command used to clone an existing repository to where you specify on your computer.

ADD

git add  is the command that adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.

COMMIT

git commit is the command that captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.

PUSH

git push is the command that we used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.
